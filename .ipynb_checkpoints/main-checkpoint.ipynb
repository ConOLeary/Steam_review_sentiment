      "X[ 0 ]:  Kinda decent f2p mmorpg that has no class limitations(hooray!)(and that game where i drained too much hours...) Community: In PvE, you may encounter friendly ppl(i managed to even encounter person that i love :o), while in PvP mostly complainers(those who complain about AT&T releasing too much of 1st in battle xD) or persons that make you turn into complainer.(As always!) Main review part: Graphics: Everything looks kinda pretty, but performance is not what expected for java and openGL...(8/10) Gameplay: SK features huge choice of equipment, which adds variety to the gear and gameplay itself(like you can use guns, or bombs, or swords.. or 2 of those... or all 3 xD) But because this game features grinding in big quantities you  may get bored(or may not if you do co-op with your friend(s))(8/10) Controls: In order to rekt m8s you need to change much(like binding weps to keys)(8/10) Setting: Kinda variable even if its supposed to be under ground.(10/10) Story: It's kinda interesting but begins to be rly interesting only when OOO decides to release new missions xD(like those new levels featuring herex 'n stuff)(8/10) Late game playability: This game features much equipment/accessories/stuff that will make you grind it to get it. Also getting last prestige badge which can take up to 5 months.(7/10) Overall rating: This game can be very good if you have friends and you're patient, but if not then it's not for ya... anyway this game doesn't cost a penny, so better try it out! Rank: A (8,2/10) P.S. review got updated at 30.10.15 and game's rank reduced.\n",
