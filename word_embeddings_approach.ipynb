'Best pirate game on the market very addictive Definitely would be better to play with friends', 'Im going to review both this game and the bonus character for  Orange Juice the game comes with because why not This game is a good entry point into the genre of bullet hells Shoot em ups with a heavier focus on difficulty and dodging projectiles as far as bullet hells go Sora actually seems to be on the easier side due to features like being immune to most energy projectiles when dashing and just by having a health bar in the first place instead of always dying in  hit still a fair warning that newcomers to the genre may find the difficulty overwhelming potentially even on easy at the later levels so I wouldnt recommend buying it to exclusively casual players Unless they REALLY want that bonus character The soundtrack is amazing and the games character sprites have a very lively animated feel to it though I feel the story might be too pretentious edgy incomprehensibly anime for some Although to be fair you can say the same for a lot of bullet hell plots anyway  The games length is pretty short under an hour of gameplay if someone were to beat the game without having to retry anything once however just like many retro games the games difficulty will make it last a lot longer when you also add in things like the escalating difficulty options variety of different weapons for the protagonist to choose from and just being fun the game has quite a bit of replay value to it Just as an example it took me  hours of playtime total to get all achievements As far as the  Orange Juice bonus character goes Military Sora is a great character for those who really hate revive rolls but dont want to be at  HP all the time like Shifu Robot with stats identical to normal Sora Military Soras gimmick is that she revives next turn automatically at half HP if she is defeated in combat Getting KOd out of battle still requires her to roll to revive due to her  HP  DEF and  EVD she has much greater survivability relatively immediately after revive compared to Shifu Robot who is unable to defend after revive and has a dismal  EVD Military Soras hyper is a more pragmatic but weaker version of regular Soras hyper roll  for all rolls that turn compared to regular Soras  but its  stars cheaper has a lower norma requirement and she can also use it as a battle card unlike normal Sora allowing her to use it defensively as a quick turnaround against an opponent in OJs coop mode she is one of the best attackers and healers around due to her gimmick allowing her to get back up quickly to continue fighting the bosshealing other players and for her stats synergizing with both roles', ' um PubgFortnite pra Otaku com alguns elementos de MOBA e com visual de RagnarokTOS

the characters and was attached to them all profoundly Connor was my favorite as the interactions between him and his partner Hank are some of the best sections in the game The amount of narrative forks in the road is staggering Simple choices can lead to entire sectionslevels that you would have skipped completely if done differently You could play this game easily a half dozen times and see different outcomes and story paths maybe even more  Towards the end of the game I was very much emotionally invested to the characters and my choices left me both satisfied and intrigued with what I could do differently next time around Within the menu theres a narrative tree that fills up as you see more of what the story has to offer Filling that out and using the currency you receive from it to buy extras is a good incentive that goes along with one of the most if not the most narratively diverse games ever made There were a few moments where I hated the game for making me choose between

they were grinding the base game all this time for God knows what reason so take my complaints with a grain of just git gud lmao The main problems stem from the fact id has either forgotten how to design good arenas or the DLC not having been developed by the main team I cant find a good reason how could they think Hey lets drop an archvile three carcasses a couple of mancubi and some other  inside a narrow corridor and come to a conclusion that is a good idea But I wish that was the main problem There is also a matter of horrendously long fights think  minutes long or shorterlonger depending on how good youre at focusing down targets that progress the fight It wouldnt have probably been such a problem had the arenas not been so small I cant tell you the exact number of times I made a wrong turn inside an arena and stumbled on  or so stacked demons who not only bodyblock you but were also bodyblocking themselves from reaching you The arenas in the first two levels barring a couple of exceptions are just not designed to accomodate large numbers of demons but designers still say  it and have you deal with them I can only really commend the last level it had WELL DESIGNED fights large enough arenas and mostly felt like a level from the base campaign The music is bland which was to be expected after Gordons departure Once again I really want to say I liked it but the tracks were so forgetable I can barely remember a single one and the one I do remember is ambient Oh did I say each level has only  combat track and it just plays on loop the entire time Good stuff Im not sure how much time did Levy and Hulshult have so it could be a time issue but I still feel like had Gordon still been around he wouldve written more than than not even mentioning the quality of his work The story ignoring the fact they continue butchering s lore is reaching cringe levels that should not be possible Whoever thought that adding a geeky nerd as a medium between the doomguys inner thoughts and the player is clearly insane When you had HaydenVEGA tell you to do stuff it made much more sense than when some INTERN says stuff out loud that is obvious even without him saying it The best example was when Hayden transfers himself into Seraphyou clearly understand that Hayden is Seraphand the first thing you hear in the next cutscene is HEY DID YOU KNOW HAYDEN IS A SERAPH

the greatness that Destiny  was after its last DLC Even more so when Bungie finally split with Activision which made me think at first that everything is going to be great from now on I thought Shadowkeep was not just going to be a good DLC but also a positive turning point for the series so I immediately bought the entire Season Pass bundle But sadly Destiny has disappointed me much more than it has positively surprised me The new Seasons just suck The new content isnt content let alone new content You basically are just playing old stuff to earn old stuff with a few new things mixed in Season Passes should ATLEAST come with a Strike Crucible Map and a Gambit Map Even that is such a bare minimum but instead we get to grind Bounties which is definitely the type of grind Ive been always looking for The new content is either just a new horde mode or gear that they recycled from Destiny  and if they add actual new gear that also looks cool it almost always is something from the Eververse Taking for example with Shadowkeeps launch We have the launch of a new raid Garden of Salvation A Garden Vex based raid that has us fighting our way through the mysterious black garden from D Within it we get a RESKINNED set of armour a new exotic weapon quest some kinetic and energy weapons and god  forbid why there is no heavy weapons is beyond me A very below average loot pool I would say for a newly released expansion raid However there is no ship no sparrow and no ghost within this raid Except what should be considered the ship and sparrow for this raid is locked behind the premium tier of the season pass And a Vex Harpy Ghost shell Harpers Shell can be purchased from EVERVERSE Why wasnt any of this moved to help fill the absence of loot in a end game activity Honestly there needs to be some kind of respect put towards these cosmetics Bungie If you are designing something that is themed to a certain activity or season dont hide it behind a Eververse paywall and actually put it down as a earnable reward in activites It shows that we have gone and earned them through either a loot drop in a end game activity or like youve done before certain high tier triumphs so as they are not as rng loot dependant Why not have the Thorn ornament as a reward for solo flawless creates a sense ofpride and accomplishment for doing so rather then just an emblem Before finishing this review I quickly just want to point out a few other things Surprisingly small Trials pool with the armor being yet another reskin No ritual weapons Quite a lot of hackers More error codes than you could humanly count Still no vendor refresh This season is a bounty simulator again Strikes are STILL useless after YEARS of feedback Another season without a raid with no word of how often we can expect them or even when we can expect the next one Eververse seems to get the most attention Looks like the only balance bungie really cares about is the one for my bank account Just the general amount and quality of content is lacking It honestly feels like Destiny  has been in a slow decline since they parted ways with Activision because at that time they got someone to put pressure on them to make actual content Wether the content was good or not it was still content and not hours of Bounty grinding which doesnt mean that I want them back because the Eververse is already bad enough Edit The new event Guardian Games is about deciding which Class is the best one not by doing challenges that take skill and would be fun but by boring bounty grinding Bungie is really putting a hell lot of effort into these huh ', 'Review text hidden', 'Simple puzzle with cats Nothing more to add There are  levels And sadly game doesnt save your completed levels It doesnt even have a feature

hells Shoot em ups with a heavier focus on difficulty and dodging projectiles as far as bullet hells go Sora actually seems to be on the easier side due to features like being immune to most energy projectiles when dashing and just by having a health bar in the first place instead of always dying in  hit still a fair warning that newcomers to the genre may find the difficulty overwhelming potentially even on easy at the later levels so I wouldnt recommend buying it to exclusively casual players Unless they REALLY want that bonus character The soundtrack is amazing and the games character sprites have a very lively animated feel to it though I feel the story might be too pretentious edgy incomprehensibly anime for some Although to be fair you can say the same for a lot of bullet hell plots anyway  The games length is pretty short under an hour of gameplay if someone were to beat the game without having to retry anything once however just like many retro games the games difficulty will make it last a lot longer when you also add in things like the escalating difficulty options variety of different weapons for the protagonist to choose from and just being fun the game has quite a bit of replay value to it Just as an example it took me  hours of playtime total to get all achievements As far as the  Orange Juice bonus character goes Military Sora is a great character for those who really hate revive rolls but dont want to be at  HP all the time like Shifu Robot with stats identical to normal Sora Military Soras gimmick is that she revives next turn automatically at half HP if she is defeated in combat Getting KOd out of battle still requires her to roll to revive due to her  HP  DEF and  EVD she has much greater survivability relatively immediately after revive compared to Shifu Robot who is unable to defend after revive and has a dismal  EVD Military Soras hyper is a more pragmatic but weaker version of regular Soras hyper roll  for all rolls that turn compared to regular Soras  but its  stars cheaper has a lower norma requirement and she can also use it as a battle card unlike normal Sora allowing her to use it defensively as a quick turnaround against an opponent in OJs coop mode she is one of the best attackers and healers around due to her gimmick allowing her to get back up quickly to continue fighting the bosshealing other

choices left me both satisfied and intrigued with what I could do differently next time around Within the menu theres a narrative tree that fills up as you see more of what the story has to offer

those levels the game is not rewarding You just have another soundtrack and new areas You dont have a real reason to go on not even a story If you tell your story with some surrounding like dark souls it would be great But no story at all with this beatiful art and soundtrack is just sad Well and then you have so frustrating controls Sometimes the shift button dont react or is just stuck and then you have the level where you are falling Honestly sometimes this game has to many random facts if you are falling fast or just slow and dont reach the ground It was so frustrating that i give up on

but I just cant bring myself to Ill admit I was a bit rusty at the beginningalmost everyone would unless they were grinding the base game all this time for God knows what reason so take my complaints with a grain of just git gud lmao The main problems stem from the fact id has either forgotten how to design good arenas or the DLC not having been developed by the main team I cant find a good reason how could they think Hey lets drop an archvile three carcasses a couple of mancubi and some other  inside a narrow corridor and come to a conclusion that is a good idea But I wish that was the main problem There is also a matter of horrendously long fights think  minutes long or shorterlonger depending on how good youre at focusing down targets that progress the fight It wouldnt have probably been such a problem had the arenas not been so small I cant tell you the exact number of times I made a wrong turn inside an arena and stumbled on  or so stacked demons who not only bodyblock you but were also bodyblocking themselves from reaching you The arenas in the first two levels barring a couple of exceptions are just not designed to accomodate large numbers of demons but designers still say  it and have you deal with them I can only really commend the last level it had WELL DESIGNED fights large enough arenas and mostly felt like a level from the base campaign The music is bland which was to be expected after Gordons departure Once again I really want to say I liked it but the tracks were so forgetable I can barely remember a single one and the one I do remember is ambient Oh did I say each level has only  combat track and it just plays on loop the entire time Good stuff Im not sure how much time did Levy and Hulshult have so it could be a time issue but I still feel like had Gordon still been around he wouldve written more than than not even mentioning the quality of his work The story ignoring the fact they continue butchering s lore is reaching cringe levels that should not be possible Whoever thought that adding a geeky nerd as a medium between the doomguys inner thoughts and the player is clearly insane When you had HaydenVEGA tell you to do stuff it made much more sense than when some INTERN says stuff out loud that is obvious even without him saying it The best example was when Hayden transfers himself into Seraphyou clearly understand that Hayden is Seraphand the first thing you hear in the next cutscene is HEY DID YOU KNOW HAYDEN IS A SERAPH HES BEEN WITH US THE ENTIRE TIME No  dude My expectations for part  are even lower than they were for

achieve the greatness that Destiny  was after its last DLC Even more so when Bungie finally split with Activision which made me think at first that everything is going to be great from now on I thought Shadowkeep was not just going to be a good DLC but also a positive turning point for the series so I immediately bought the entire Season Pass bundle But sadly Destiny has disappointed me much more than it has positively surprised me The new Seasons just suck The new content isnt content let alone new content You basically are just playing old stuff to earn old stuff with a few new things mixed in Season Passes should ATLEAST come with a Strike Crucible Map and a Gambit Map Even that is such a bare minimum but instead we get to grind Bounties which is definitely the type of grind Ive been always looking for The new content is either just a new horde mode or gear that they recycled from Destiny  and if they add actual new gear that also looks cool it almost always is something from the Eververse Taking for example with Shadowkeeps launch We have the launch of a new raid Garden of Salvation A Garden Vex based raid that has us fighting our way through the mysterious black garden from D Within it we get a RESKINNED set of armour a new exotic weapon quest some kinetic and energy weapons and god  forbid why there is no heavy weapons is beyond me A very below average loot pool I would say for a newly released expansion raid However there is no ship no sparrow and no ghost within this raid Except what should be considered the ship and sparrow for this raid is locked behind the premium tier of the season pass And a Vex Harpy Ghost shell Harpers Shell can be purchased from EVERVERSE Why wasnt any of this moved to help fill the absence of loot in a end game activity Honestly there needs to be some kind of respect put towards these cosmetics Bungie If you are designing something that is themed to a certain activity or season dont hide it behind a Eververse paywall and actually put it down as a earnable reward in activites It shows that we have gone and earned them through either a loot drop in a end game activity or like youve done before certain high tier triumphs so as they are not as rng loot dependant Why not have the Thorn ornament as a reward for solo flawless creates a sense ofpride and accomplishment for doing so rather then just an emblem Before finishing this review I quickly just want to point out a few other things Surprisingly small Trials pool with the armor being yet another reskin No ritual weapons Quite a lot of hackers More error codes than you could humanly count Still no vendor refresh This season is a bounty simulator again Strikes are STILL useless after YEARS of feedback Another season without a raid with no word of how often we can expect them or even when we can expect the next one Eververse seems to get the most attention Looks like the only balance bungie really cares about is the one for my bank account Just the general amount and quality of content is lacking It honestly feels like Destiny  has been in a slow decline since they parted ways with Activision because at that time they got someone to put pressure on them to make actual content Wether the content was good or not it was still content and not hours of Bounty grinding which doesnt mean that I want them back because the Eververse is already bad enough Edit The new event Guardian Games is about deciding which Class is the best one not by doing challenges that take skill and would be fun but by boring bounty grinding Bungie is really putting a hell lot of effort into these huh ', 'Simple puzzle with cats Nothing more to add There are  levels And sadly game doesnt save your completed levels It doesnt even have a feature to choose a level',
