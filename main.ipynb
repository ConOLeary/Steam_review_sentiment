Main review part: Graphics: Everything looks kinda pretty, but performance is not what expected for java and openGL...(8/10) Gameplay: SK features huge choice of equipment, which adds variety to the gear and gameplay itself(like you can use guns, or bombs, or swords.. or 2 of those... or all 3 xD) But because this game features grinding in big quantities you  may get bored(or may not if you do co-op with your friend(s))(8/10) Controls: In order to rekt m8s you need to change much(like binding weps to keys)(8/10) Setting: Kinda variable even if its supposed to be under ground.(10/10) Story: It's kinda interesting but begins to be rly interesting only when OOO decides to release new missions xD(like those new levels featuring herex 'n stuff)(8/10) Late game playability: This game features much equipment/accessories/stuff that will make you grind it to get it. Also getting last prestige badge which can take up to 5 months.(7/10) Overall rating: This game can be very good if you have friends and you're patient, but if not then it's not for ya... anyway this game doesn't cost a penny, so better try it out!

Not too surprising for me because I like the Nimble Neurons other games too which also has a very detailed and neat art style. The only negative for me is that the game is F2P.

      "X[ 33 ]:  This game is highly addicting and a blast to play with friends! The goal is to reach the end without dying as you pick up gold, ore, and items as you progress through the dungeons. When you die you lose everything and respawn back in your town.  Gold and ore can be sent back to your town from within the dungeons through an elevator. When you die you will not lose gold or ore that you sent back. Back in town you can buy permanent upgrades to your character and town to help you progress further. In town you can also buy some gear to start your new adventure with as well as other things. Dying can be very frustrating but unlike most perma-death games, you are always advancing your character. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a cheap yet amazing game to play with friends or even anyone looking for a challenge to play solo! The developers are amazing and I've gotten way more than my moneys worth with all of the content this game has to offer. I've had more fun with this game than I have with most AAA titles.

      "X[ 43 ]:  There have been many superhero games throughout the years.  Most of them have been sidescrolling \"beat 'em ups\" in the  vein of the Final Fight series.  Others were horrible adaptations like the Superman game for the N64.  Arkham Asylum has been, with few minor exceptions, one of the most on-point adaptations of a superhero property into a game that I have ever played.   First, the format, a 3-D \"metroidvania/Legend of Zelda\" type deal where new tools open new areas and items to get, plays nicely into the feel of the game.   That same format also helps with the \"lone hero\" feeling that is in many ways the essence of Batman.  You feel like yes, you are alone, but you aren't out of your depth.  Also, the classic animated series voices help set the tone of the game; dark with just a bit of humor here and there. The game world is lush and well rendered, created in that gritty style also befiting a game about The Bat.  Ruined sewers, secret tunnels, and crawling through airways and up walls all give this sense of being secretive, careful, and thought out.  The world you have been given to play in is tailor made to adhere to the common action/stealth tropes that exist in other Batman works. The combat and movement can be . . . halting at times.  In particular the \"hold button to run\" command, something that I thought I had seen the end of when analog sticks came to prominent use, feels forced and unintuitive.  When the combat flows, slighlty pauses on a big hit, and Batman is leaping to and fro kicking, punching and generally kicking ass, it looks good, and it feels good to be doing it, but there aren't any ways to \"do\" the one move you like, really.  And the combat system is at its best when you have maxed out all your available attack options. The fightable enemies are simple and never waver from the basic human stock of \"Joker goon fight\"; they are either unarmed, armed with a melee weapon, armed with a firearm, a stun baton, or they are giant mutant freaks.  This includes the \"boss fights\", making the gameplay and world far more engaging than the actual combat.  That said, most of the combat is short and simple.  I think the longest normal skirmish took maybe a minute.  And the best parts of combat aren't specifically the combat so much as the setpieces where you have high perches to disappear to.  You can swoop down, take out a goon, and then grapple up into the shadows, listening and watching as the other goons start to freak out as you take them down one by one. And finally the story, which at least matches the quality of the old animated Batman series movies for plots.  Joker has a crazy plan, and Batman has to stop him.  The winding way Bruce has to do this is what makes up the bulk of the game.  Some of the story points feel contrived, but overall, the story flows from point to point in a logical way.  What helps in this is that Batman himself often tells the player (and Oracle over his headset) the next step.  And when Batman tells you something in this game, a combination of the voicework and the writing just seems to make the next plotpoint make sense. With solid voicework, a lonely, beautifully crafted world, and a combat and stealth system that is only sometimes marred by its own trappings, this is a solid, wonderfully made title that anyone who counts themselves as a superhero fan in general or a Batman fan in particular should own.\n",

      "X[ 46 ]:  Antihero is a great little indie game that is easy to learn but hard to master. It takes a lot of in-depth consideration, especially for the multiplayer mode. This is easily my favourite 'board game' online and the small Dev team has done an excellent job. The game takes up minimal space ( less than 200mb) and this is one of those games you keep in your library for a quick play when you're in the mood. Some thing I would love to see in the future: - Link steam account to the mobile version and allow cross platform play (vastly increase player database). - New maps and multiplayer mode, allowing up to 4 players at once. - Campaign expansion with new missions. - Weekly / Monthly missions and/or puzzles. - Additional future skins. - Allow workshop / community submissions for maps / puzzles. - DLC expansion packs (to support the Devs). I would be more than happy to purchase DLC to continue support. - Look at an actual Antihero board game (Will need some tweaks, specifically with incorporating the \"fog of war\", however this could be what monopoly deal is to monopoly). All of these recommendations are in the art of the possible and I believe would truly add to the game and community. Don't let my gameplay hours fool you, I've put a lot more in offline mode and other platforms. I highly recommend this game and look forward to what the future will bring. Great Job Devs!\n",

      "X[ 56 ]:  This game reminds me of when I was in grade school.  When I was in 3rd-4th grade I made all A's in my classes. The classes weren't that hard and everyone thought that I was this super smart genius child. As I got older, my grades began to drop as the classes got harder.  \"What's wrong with you?\"  \"You're so smart! You should be doing so much better than this!\"  I had built up a reputation of being so smart that when I got to something that challenged me, everyone assumed that I wasnt trying to do well.  I feel that Defiance suffers from a similar problem. There's your tldr Defiance suffers from the same problem that other Trion Worlds games suffers from. Much like ArcheAge, another F2P MMO released by Trion, I really, really like this game, but i just can't bring myself to say that this is a game that everyone should play. Obviously, I have some serious love/hate issues with Defiance. To better illustrate this, let me point out some pros and cons. +Excellent gunplay - I seriously feel that the gunplay in Defiance is one of the most solid gunplay     experiences I've played with in other MMO shooter games. Obviously this is an open world game, so dont compare this to COD, but considering all the effort that was put elsewhere, The combat in Defiance is an excellent experience. +BALANCE - I feel that creating a balanced game in an MMO setting is arguably one of the hardest things a developer can do, and as with the aformentioned ArcheAge, no matter what happens, there will always be one specific class that can outperform the other classes (ie. Archers in ArcheAge). However, what Defiance did, and i feel that more devs should do this, was that all abilities are available to be unlocked, regardless of any specifications put into your character. This is through the EGO system (basically exp). As your EGO rises, you can purchase new perks and abilities, and eventually unlock all abilities available to everyone, however you can only use 1 ability at a time. +Great Storytelling - For those of you who maybe didnt play Defiance when it first launched, Defiance was actually a tie-in to a televison show on SyFy by the same name. The concept was pretty cool (in my opinion at least). As events unfolded in the show, events in the game would occur, and vice versa. so obviously, the writers of Defiance (the show) wanted to deliver an experience that would be engaging to the players of Defiance (the game). As such, the entire story of Defiance (the game) was developed in close conjunction with the writers of the show, and well, they arent professional writers if they were bad. Also, the show that the game originally launched with has since stopped airing, or has gone so far under the radar that I can no longer find it on any current tv network and I think that's kinda funny. -Pay-to-Play(?) - So I actually bought Defiance when there was still a $10 price tag on it and honestly  I kinda regret doing that. Since I did that the game has gone F2P and has seen a resurgence in player activity, BUT Trion still needs to generate revenue somehow. Trion has released several DLC packs for Defiance as tie-ins for events that happened in the aforementioned televison show, such as the Castithan Charge pack which allows players to play as the Castithan race. Normally this wouldn't really be a problem if it weren't for the Gunslinger Trials and the 7th Legion packs. This problem does extend to the other packs, but I think that the Gunslinger trials and 7th legions packs are the worst. The problem is that, like in other MMO's you can recieve weapon loot from fallen enemies, BUT you can also recieve weapons from the DLC packs. However, YOU CANNOT USE THESE WEAPONS UNLESS YOU PAY FOR THEM. This is a huge problem if you love a great loot system like I do, because you can hoard all these weapons that are considerably better than the weapons you currently have, but if you dont pay actual real-world money, you cant use these weapons. I've seriously wanted to buy the packs just to get access to those weapons, but I refuse to spend more money on an F2P game to get access to weapons that I can get in the base game -Lack of direction - IDK if this is the right way to phrase this, but despite all the effort put into the story, I dont really care about it. I like to play a game that challenges me, and the best way i usually think of to find a challenge is to move on to the next area with tougher enemies. Apparently you shouldnt do this, because it can ruin some of the story, but like I said, I appreciate the extensive work put into the story, but I just dont find it super interesting. So, to summarize the points that I made, I really do think that Defiance is a fun game, but it suffers from a problem that Trion has had yet to fix in this game or in many of their other games.  However, this game is F2P now, so take my advise with a grain of salt.  Play this game Form your own opinion If you really like it, give in to Trion's iron grip on your wallet and buy the Season Pass for some extra fun.  Overall I'd give this game a 6/10 I really want to like this game, but there's just so much in the way of this game being great.\n",

      "X[ 62 ]:  is a point-and-click horror/adventure game that lasts about two and a half hours. Right up until the last five minutes or so, I thought I was following the plot pretty well. Then the Big Reveal finally came, the nature of the game's paranormal threat was explained, and... I still don't get what was \"really\" supposed to be going on. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the ride. The story is paced well, with creepy elements being added in just the right amounts and increments to keep the narrative momentum going (and the player feeling increasingly uneasy). The voice acting is also quite good for what appears to be a fairly low-budget game (video game critic Jim Sterling plays a supporting character). A warning though: this is not a game for puzzle fans. Most of the game unfolds through simple fetch quests (\"Hey friend, would you go to the bar and get me a shot of whiskey?\") and the resulting dialogue upon completion of said fetching (\"Thanks for the whiskey. Hey, did I ever tell you about....\"). A few puzzles are interspersed here and there, but the answers are so heavily hinted that I was never stuck for more than thirty seconds or so -- and this is coming from a guy who almost always resorts to a walkthrough at least a few times before finishing most other adventure games. In other words, play   for its story and atmosphere rather than for an intellectual challenge. Oh, and just in case you're confused by the game's title: it's called a \"Trilogy\" because it's told in three chapters (each lasting about 45 minutes). All three chapters are included when you buy the game, and are all accessed from one main menu. As far as I know, there aren't any other games in the series besides this one (though I believe a sequel is planned).\n",

      "X[ 64 ]:  This game was made in support of net neutrality and that made me keen to play this right off the bat. 404Sight starts with an urgent message delivered to the player via a text prompt. After reading, the player is sent in the game for a brief tutorial. The game flows from the tutorial right into the first stage. The essential point is to find your way through each stage and into the next one. This game is more about the journey than anything else. There is more than one way to free run through the levels and part of the fun is exploring the different ways to do so. There are obstacles getting in the way of your progress. Some obstacles slow/damage your character. To avoid this your character can speed boost through obstacles or turn off their â€œpingâ€. Ping reveals channels that speed your character up and well as obstacles that slow you down. If you turn off ping you wonâ€™t be damaged or slowed but then you canâ€™t go as fast. Your clear time for each level is tracked, so thatâ€™s something to keep in mind. This 3D platforming game has the player running through a world that looks like it was modeled after the computer internals ala Tron. Being a fan of Tron, ReBoot, The Matrix (no yelling please), I like media that engages the idea of the inner world of electronics. It was fun to run around in this digital world. This is a 3D platform game. The mechanics are centered on getting the player to manage their speed and direction to navigate the terrain and get out of the level. There are many spatial challenges that, improperly navigated, will cause the player to resume from the last check point. You can turn your â€œPingâ€ on or off to avoid slowing traps or to access speed boots, jump pads, and to charge your energy. As you run around you will notice that Ada will flip, posture, and tumble in a way similar to free-running.  It was intentional and does make maneuvering the levels more fun to watching. You are â€œAdaâ€ and one of your friends online has given you an .exe that you need to deliver before it gets into the wrong hands. This is a 3D game, with what I would call fairly well rendered graphics. The game is not super intense with textures, high poly animated characters, particle effects, or anything that necessarily requires praise for the art style. Most of the assets are kept simple. What is done well is the assets are clean looking. The layouts of the levels are also inventive and varied. The use of the jump pads and the vertical order of the levels make for a great view while traversing (NOTE: looking around while soaring through the air will change where or if you land).  There are some seams in the levels that I have been able to walk through, but thatâ€™s another story.\n",

      "X[ 71 ]:  If you managed to avoid spoilers about this game since it was released, then I can tell you that it's still absolutely worth playing. Life is Strange is a story about Max Caulfield, a girl who discovers she can rewind time as she pleases. She needs to overcome high school drama and save Arcadia Bay from itself with her childhood friend Chloe Price. But there's more to this game than just a well-written story. Here's why you should play it. First of all, i'm sure you've heard it a million times from other reviews or friends of yours, but this game's story completely rocks. It's filled with tense moments, comedy, drama and just purely good story telling. There's nothing more you can wish from a great story. It does an astounding job at building the characters and making you feel for them. It's overall a beautiful experience. The art style is definitely one of the best out there, it perfectly borders reality and the game, not being too realistic while not going for a fully-fledged video game appearance. It's a perfect balance, all the better for keeping you at the edge of your seat, since you can still sometimes forget it's just a game. Also, the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a game, and has a place right up there with Hyper Light Drifter for me. It features outstanding acoustic guitar songs and manages to create a truly atmospheric expreience for the player. The main thing I disliked about the game was the length of the episodes. There are some filler scenes that don't contribute to the story in any way, but thankfully you can avoid some of them. Even this is a plus if you like more content and more insight on the backstory of Arcadia Bay and its residents. You can squeeze out about 4-5 hours from each episode if you play it the completionist way. A big game changer was also that, in the end, your choices throughout the game mean absolutely nothing. Whatever you do, there are still two endings you can choose from right in the last 10 minutes of gameplay. That kind of made the whole game and emotions I went through obsolete. And lastly, some of Max's dialogue options or actions make you facepalm yourself since all of you with a common sense can find that there are more logical aproaches to a situation than what you can do in the game. But, thankfully, these situations are scarce. Victoria. 'Nuff said. In the end, for me, this game is a fond memory of my loving girlfriend and it will always hold a special place in my heart, no matter how good or bad Life is Strange might actually be. I played it alongside her and I enjoyed every second of the time we spent togheter with this amazing game. And whether you are alone or not, you will cherish the chance to play this game. Trust me on this one, folks. And with episode 1 being free, you can pretty much build an opinion for yourself about it, so there's really no reason to delay playing it. If you liked the first episode and want more of this beautiful story, every other part of the game is more of what you love about it.  PROS: +absolutely mind-blowing story +the art style +the branching paths in gameplay +magnificent soundtrack CONS: -episodes are a bit lengthy and boredom sometimes intervenes -it all boils down to two choices in the end -Victoria (god I hate her)\n",

CJ returns back to Los Santos to his mom's funeral, things were as they use to be. CJ decides to stay in Los Santos, he re-builds his reputation and helps Grove Street back to the top. Everything seems to go for them, then one day he finds out Big Smoke and Ryder are with Ballas. Officer Tenpenny drives You out of the city into the countryside. There Cj meets new people and he travels to San Fierro he there meets  Wu Zi Mu, Z and FBI Agent. He helps them.

He comes back to Los Santos and finds out that Ballas took everything over. With his new friends CJ is job is now to bring balance to Los Santos as there is a chaos on the street, he kills Big Smoke and Officer Tenpenny and restores balance back to Los Santos.

      "X[ 91 ]:  A relaxing casual game. Keep in mind that the base game + some DLCs are free. Frequently new DLCs are added.  Very pixelated (duh) look. Looks very simplistic butin the end it doesn't need to look fancy. The art is hard for me to review. Some of it is very good while others are just decent. It depends on your taste. The DLCs are themed based so if you're not a fan of planets than you might want to avoid the space DLC. The music was not to my taste so it got muted fast. A simplistic but efficient UI, The look and feel can be adjusted to your own liking with the seasonal effects and such. Those effects are a cute touch but in my opinion over the top. After you finish a 'drawing' you get a review animation on the progress. This game is very easy for all ages. My 6 year old daughter enjoys this very much. A big negative point for me, is the stability of this game. It often crashes on me and takes forever to load. I can play new AAA games on high but  this game is do-able for me on medium and often needs several minutes to load. Many achievements in this game and with each added DLC you'll have the joy to get more.\n",

      "X[ 110 ]:  Out of all the Far Cry games, this one is   and I love it. Let me tell you why. All the good stuff in game down below. â— The AI might seem simplistic at first, but they are sharp as knife. They hear you whenever you stealth kill a guard, pull out a weapon, move in bushes. Every move you make, they can hear out and instantly know where you are. For some, this might be retarded, but for others, a pleasant thing. This makes you get creative about destroying outposts etc.. â— Bunch of weapons to choose from, from flare guns to IED's. Variety of ways destroying convoys, assasinations etc... â— The setting itself, it looks just as Central-Africa, large deserts, jungles, savannas and  animals moving around. There is just something about that orange look I love. â— Fun and appropriate side missions, enjoyable assasinations, blowing up weapon convoys, same goes for buddy missions â— At some point story becomes cool, intense as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. â— Golden AK's, nuff said. â— Exploring with Glider is the most enjoyable thing ever until you get one shotted midair by a guard with a fricking pistol miles away. â— Weapon jam, suck it FC3 and FC4 â— Malaria to remember you that approximately 30-40 mins in real life have passed by. â— Instantly respawning guards at guard posts to make you mad and waste your ammo and health kits. Hell I love this, wish FC3&4 had it. A few negative things also though - Basicly every mission requires you to drive someplace far asf and the instant spawning guardposts might trigger some players. - Glitches here and there. - Cars doesn't feel like cars, they get stuck everywhere, always the same speed, sound...\n",

      "X[ 114 ]:  Elite has been around for a while, and to be honest the game feels sort of shallow to me. Before people say i haven't played enough I've only got 70 hours ish, i played a few hundred on Xbox then switched my account to PC. The reason i say its shallow is I've had many friends buy the game since it looks amazing etc, and it does don't get me wrong. But the thing is since i knew the game meta (mining) i told my friends about it, showed them it, and they were able to get a conda in like 3 days with a few mining trips. A veteran might say there's more then just mining that he hasn't experienced the whole game, which is true. Thing is though if your the type of player that really wants significant progression there isn't much to do  after you get the top tier ships ( or just Conda, which in many cases is on par or better then the other 2  ). Yes you could do engineering but that's only really needed for PvP or thargoid hunting, and both don't really give you a reward. I really feel like after you get a Conda there just isn't a reason to keep playing in terms of progression. You don't need Engineering it wont help you go up the ladder since your already there, the only thing after the Conda would be the grind for the other 2 big boys, but at the end of the day your just going to be doing courer missions for efficiency. The reason im recommending this game is because i enjoy it, It didn't take me long to get a Billion ingame, and the only reason im still playing is to get the Corvette (one of the big boys), but if your a progression type of guy, you only play to get something new, get more gear loot etc This isn't a game for you, do a few mining runs and you will get one of the best ships in the game within days. In my opinion its hard to treat Elite like a game, its more of a experience you play because its immersive the sort of where YOU make your story, journey etc. Buy the game if your willing to just experience the game after you've completed it. Its a great game but reaally needs a higher ceiling. Lets hope that odyssey does that\n",

      "X[ 123 ]:  Well, here be the last part of the   series, hailing from RoseVerte's collection. It sure is not among the best in their catalogue with questionable art choices and some blatant weeaboo humor, yet still the long wait in the series' completion delivers justly with a wonderful plot twist. We have waited so long for the revelation of our hacker, right? Well, allow me to say that none of us guessed this one correctly - and there were a lot more at stake on this game than we were aware of to begin with. Well, about the storyline, I'll try my best not the spoil things for the reader, yet I have to warn you priorly.   is the last part of the series, and it is mandatory to play this one, the last. The first game,   introduces us to the concept of the VR game and our participants; the second game,   reveals some elements about the past of our protagonist; and the third game,   simply nudges our attention deeper towards the unspoken mysteries of this VR game. This game is where all our prior questions will be answered, and presumable odd repetition of the prior events will be explained.  Oh, I already said too much. Give it a chance, and all will be revealed. Paying closer attention to the character of our chosen beau, Kurenai is a sly arsehole to say the least. He is pretty, flamboyant, witty and deliberately cruel on all manners of social interactions. You know the type that you'd love to hate, yet end as hating to love? He is that kind. With his identity explained at the finale of the series, even his character shines under a different light - that is a feat masterfully handled by RoseVerte. Kurenai is different compared to all others, as we may have noticed priorly. This time, we will end up being paired with him, even though such wasn't our choice. Did the hacker succeed in this timeline? Well, you see, Kurenai has a mission to pursue in this odd Dream World - one he'll see through, even if that would be the last thing he'd do. As you may have noticed, the gameplay takes a different direction in each game, and it has been the hardest for this final one. Our challenges do contain some mini games this time, which would require your attention to detail and even skills on time management. As the game comes to an end, an opportunity for the truth emerges. This is also the longest game in the series, containing both an outlay of the game in the VR world, your usual character interaction process and the end-game revelations that would require some in-depth story elements to be analyzed. It would take one A rated and three S rated playthroughs to see all endings - considering aggressive/passive answer scale presents different outcomes for the nature of the relationship, giving you a total of 6-7 hours of playtime - and also relevant achievements. Could I recommend this one, knowing that it lacks a lot in display quality? I surely can, considering its story elements and character progression is handled wonderfully. If you are patient in your discovery, series do deliver by the end. If this is the worst title in RoseVerte's catalogue, I can wholeheartedly congratulate the developer. Wonderful work indeed!

      "X[ 138 ]:  I'm going to review both this game and the bonus character for 100% Orange Juice the game comes with, because why not? This game is a good entry point into the genre of bullet hells (Shoot 'em ups with a heavier focus on difficulty and dodging projectiles.), as far as bullet hells go Sora actually seems to be on the easier side due to features like being immune to most energy projectiles when dashing and just by having a health bar in the first place instead of always dying in 1 hit, still, a fair warning that newcomers to the genre may find the difficulty overwhelming, potentially even on easy at the later levels, so I wouldn't recommend buying it to exclusively casual players. (Unless they REALLY want that bonus character.) The soundtrack is amazing and the game's character sprites have a very lively animated feel to it, though I feel the story might be too \"pretentious edgy incomprehensibly anime\" for some. (Although to be fair you can say the same for a lot of bullet hell plots anyway.)  The game's length is pretty short, under an hour of gameplay if someone were to beat the game without having to retry anything once, however, just like many retro games the game's difficulty will make it last a lot longer, when you also add in things like the escalating difficulty options, variety of different weapons for the protagonist to choose from, and just being fun, the game has quite a bit of replay value to it. (Just as an example it took me 23 hours of playtime total to get all achievements.) As far as the 100% Orange Juice bonus character goes, Military Sora is a great character for those who really hate revive rolls but don't want to be at 1 HP all the time like Shifu Robot, with stats identical to normal Sora, Military Sora's gimmick is that she revives next turn automatically at half HP if she is defeated in combat (Getting KO'd out of battle still requires her to roll to revive.), due to her 2 HP, 0 DEF, and +1 EVD she has much greater survivability (relatively) immediately after revive compared to Shifu Robot, who is unable to defend after revive and has a dismal -1 EVD, Military Sora's hyper is a more pragmatic but weaker version of regular Sora's hyper, roll 5 for all rolls that turn compared to regular Sora's 6, but it's 10 stars cheaper, has a lower norma requirement, and she can also use it as a battle card unlike normal Sora allowing her to use it defensively as a quick turnaround against an opponent, in OJ's co-op mode she is one of the best attackers and healers around due to her gimmick allowing her to get back up quickly to continue fighting the boss/healing other players, and for her stats synergizing with both roles.\n",

Using a mod with real names (either 2007 or in my case 1989 F1) makes the game a lot more enjoyable because you're a lot more connected with real teams and drivers. Pro: - easy access, but anyway enough \"depth\" to keep the game interesting - setting up the car during the practice to get the best balance (can sometimes also be annoying) - interesting races and \"cute\" graphics - building/developping new parts and deciding which driver/car will get it is interesting - F1 drama (your driver wins some races and suddenly has a new attribute self-important. Or your 2nd driver is unhappy because your other driver has the better car) Contra: - It's not possible to sign contracts in advance for next season. If you want to sign a driver, it's always immediately, causing a contract penalty - It seems like I only get bad sponsors even though my market rate isn't that bad - the e-mails from press/fans after and between races are way too repetitive\n",

      "X[ 160 ]:  Niche is a calm and fun game. It can get boring sometimes, but taking a break from it or making a challenge for your tribe is quite a good way to fix that. There are many different genetics and mutations you can unlock. I've been wanting this game for a while now, and I'm glad I got it. You can have mutiple tribes at a time and there is also a story mode, which gives you a tutorial of the game. You can rename the creatures, and you can have sickly children if their immunity gene is doubled up. That's a good thing to keep in mind when breeding your creatures. You start out with a male and female creature and you build your tribe off of them and their genetics. You can collect berries and hunt moles & rabbits. Another thing to keep in mind is the poison berries. If the creature eating poison berries doesn't have poison fangs, the berries will shorten their life. There are different ports which will bring you to different islands and biomes. Islands randomly generate, but you can usually tell if the island is easy or hard based on It's color or what's on it, like, flowers, bones etc. Anyway, Niche is a great game to have if you don't really have anything to play. I do think It's better to get during sales, though. $20 seems like a bit much, in my opinion. But so far, It's an amazing game. I already knew quite a bit about it, because of a youtuber who played it, so I use some of the things I learnt from her videos to help my tribe. The soundtrack is quite good, too. But, yeah. I recommend this game because of those reasons. If you get this game, I hope you like it! Bai!\n",

      "X[ 161 ]:  is yet another game from the Choice of Games, a company that prides itself in delivering the most compelling text adventures and creating countless lifelike worlds. This adventure takes place in a world inspired by ancient Greece. The society is ruled with a similar model to self governing cities like Athens. The Pantheon is also heavily inspired by the classic Roman and Greek gods and mythology. Itâ€™s all set in motion, when the main character awakes to a great danger and feels drawn to it, knowing their time to shine has come. This unexpected surge of power is immediately cause of great concern. As they face a journey to seek the Oracleâ€™s sight, the seers reveal that the main character is indeed the Champion that the gods were awaiting. This means the protagonist will have to leave the village soon and start their quest: cleansing the lands of Agossa from the leftover threats of the First Age, when humans were monstrous creatures with magical powers. The youngster is led to a congress of gods. They are surprised as with the events of past days Daggoras, the god of chaos is trying to meddle with the heroâ€™s fate. The time for the protagonistâ€™s departure has come and with it the perils. The Demena Pass on their way to Kelinos is rumored to be infested by unnatural creatures. There they encounter the first trial to be cleared. In the town, they are offered a renomated place in the Kelinosâ€™s army, together with the required training. Here the character will also encounter their romantic interest. Another encounter with the gods occurs, where they point to the championâ€™s next target. The success in this quest will also grant the champion the blessings for their marriage, if they decided to pursue a relationship. They reach an island and fight another ancient monster. As it  is defeated, a menacing green miasma heads towards Kelinos. This calamity is revealed to have transformed the people of the town into stone as well, slowly leading them towards death.  To save the city and their loved one, the champion has no other choice than conquer the secrets of Minodia, a legendary town of healers. On their way they meet again the God of Chaos in disguise. He finally uncovers his goal to them. As long as the Destiny bounds everyoneâ€™s choices, there is no freedom. This meeting gives the other gods the possibility to capture their unruly brother. As the champion approaches the queen of Minodia, their plea for help is misinterpreted as an attempt to steal the source of their magic. This magic is then revealed to have a treacherous nature to those who are exposed to it for too long. The hero returns to Kelinos and is joined by their remaining family for the wedding, but it is interrupted. The gods need their help once more, urgently. Here takes place the last encounter with Daggoras This is the where the champion will thake the last and most important choice, no matter if it might bring glory or doom. The name of this game is unique, as for once it does not start with â€œA Choice ofâ€¦â€. After having completed the game, the reason behind this is clear. The story is a reflection about the freedom of choice and whether it actually exists. Just like the champion is tied to their destiny, so is the player who has to follow the plot, until that one final decision. This will give the player a glimpse of hope in possibility to make their own choices. , when it has moral implications - if a task is not completed, it will influence other people, including those dearest to the hero. The Destiny leads to a greater good, but at the same time, with no Chaos, no actual freedom of choice,   and there is no further purpose to it than existing. This is interestingly enough shown in the Underworld, which is ruled by mechanoids and such are the Weavers. In some points the coherency of the plot is somewhat lacking. It is said that gods should not intervene with the champions' fate, but they help them multiple times all the same. Does it mean that the Destiny is in fact imperfect and needs to be constantly fueled, or does it represent the worldâ€™s dichotomy between the Chaos and Order? As many other Choice of Games stories, it is   with the possibility of naming the character and choosing a male, female or gender neutral noun, as well as showing many different views on sexuality. The choices influence both character and physical attributes - resilience, strength and speed. While usually this creates some choice restrictions and has a major influence on the trials, this game seems to have   due to its nature. Sentences flow nicely, now long and descriptive, now brief and decisive. World building comes with new terms that can be tied to the ancient word itâ€™s inspired by, making them  .  Linguistic register is medium-high, with words that are comprehensible, but still detain a certain flavor to them. The  r as the story on several occasions just skips forwards. Some flashbacks are also used when needed to focus on the story or to deepen the narration and show visions of prophetic nature. It is possible to  . It is also possible to activate a  , with dark background and white letters. Additionally, page change animation can be changed. A single playthrough should last anywhere between  . As the story is long, it can be   after some time with different choices to explore the character development through the story. This game is extremely well made and it is worth the asking price, if the buyer enjoys the genre.  , as the fact that the game is built to make the choices not particularly significant, could result dull to those who are new to text games.\n",

The plot is very simple; noble girl who has fallen madly in love with an orange -er I mean, her butler and wants to win him over. Being such a short game, I didn't really have time to bond with any of the characters but that didn't stop me from enjoying myself. The surprisingly decent voice acting was a nice touch which really brought the whole thing to life! The soundtrack was syrup to my ears and I loved the fact that you can not only pick the MC's name, but also the butlers! I must say, the faceless characters was an interesting choice that I'm sure would put some people off but I'm so glad I was not one of them.

      "X[ 174 ]:  Finally decided to write a review for this game as it's on sale. The developer deserves all the praises he can get. AAA quality game under 300 mb. Reminds of good ol' days of PC gaming when hardcore coders not artists / modders used to make games.  Yes its true that 'reinventing the wheel' is waste of resources. But it doesn't mean to forcefully fit the same wheel on every cart/car regardless of its purpose and size. When game are made from scratch with less reliance on generic ready made engines or recycled tools and more under the hood coding, they require less resources and run blazingly fast even on old hardware. And that is the first thing you will notice with Banished. You can feel the engine underneath while playing. It feels like you just need to press a hidden button to see everything in code Matrix style. It reminds me of the days playing Quake 3 Arena.  Very raw yet very crispy. Banished is developed by a lone coder so it doesn't have detailed tutorials, introductory videos and all other sorts of  babysitting that gamers of today have gotten used to. But for someone like me that just adds to its appeal of truly open ended sandbox game. The difficulty I had to stop letting my village starved to death was the best part of the game. And I think that is how the game should be played. Stop reading guides and experiment on your own. Because that is what the game is all about. There is no specific objectives in the game. How city building games should be. The way they are meant to be played. Having said that, the game doesn't have a huge scope like that of Total War or Civilization games. So without multiplayer, it's not a game that you can keep on playing forever. So don't rush it. Enjoy the game and try different things. This game will appeal to you if you are a gamer who likes to explore, experiment, decorate and set your own objectives. But if you are someone who likes hand holding, being told what to do while following scripted sequences one after another with specific objectives to accomplish than look elsewhere. Highly recommended!\n",

      "X[ 177 ]:  Another incredibly fun FPS. Fast and tense action. Enemies shed flesh now as you lower their health, environments are spectacular throughout, even breath taking towards later levels. The jump puzzles are fun and do well to break up the combat encounters. Extremely violent, I winced at some of the new glory kill animations. With that said, there is a speed-bump here. Upon playing for the first time, I found myself struggling as I was gravitating to how I played the previous Doom game, pretty much shoot with your available favourite gun, glory kill when you can and stay on the move. Only keeping in mind simple strategic thoughts such as save the rocket launcher for the big guys. This time around, glory kills give you extra health, setting enemies on fire with the flamethrower gives armour, and the chainsaw gives ammo for all your weapons, enough to fill them to almost half capacity if they were empty. Enemies have weapons that you can shoot off, and for the cacodemon (flying enemy) shooting a grenade or sticky bomb in its mouth will stagger it (allow you to glory kill it). Glory killing charges up a 'Blood Punch' which is a super melee attack which can take out multiple small enemies, and can help you knock off the armour of a specific big enemy. You now have a double jump and double dash which requires frequent use in and out of combat. Without going in depth on each and every weapon and enemy, basically there is another layer of thought the gameplay demands from you this time around. Personally it took some getting used to, over quite a bit of time, but it was worth it. By about the middle of the game managing my resources became second nature and in the level leading up to the BFG-10000, this song   came on at the beginning of an encounter. It was at that point I was thankful for the gameplay tweaks from the previous game. Mowing enemies down to such a fitting soundtrack is even more exhilarating when you're not allowed to make things repetitive. The previous game, as good as it was, did get repetitive by the end but that doesn't happen here. Using mission select to get the collectables I missed is a blast, and feels kind of new now that I have most of the upgrades, so there is still a lot of replayability for me yet. Multiplayer is OK, 3 player matches, one plays the slayer, the other 2 play a big demon each. It's not as fun as the death match and soccer modes of the previous games' multiplayer, but it doesn't really matter for me as the campaign is phenomenal.\n",

      "X[ 186 ]:  Play Time: 5625 hours. I only upvote with a precautionary. Like all the other DLC and microtransactions for this game, you're only buying a little time. I also feel the pricing is too high for what you're getting. With that said, the taskmasters can provide some convenience in the form of 1 extra utility auto clicker.  There are free scripts such as NIAutoclicker that do much the same thing. The extra consumables are not worth paying for since you get them frequently in game, imoho.   2 of 3 Taskmasters can be acquired in-game easy enough.  They are purchased with in-game rubies which you gain over time by completing missions and campaigns. The Taskmasters will mostly appeal to idle players who like to keep the game running. Otto Von Click is currently priced at $5. Most of the other DLC priced at $10. If your goal is to: - Support the Devs, then I vote YES.   - If your goal is to get Phat Loot or make significant progress, then I vote NO.\n",

      "X[ 187 ]:  This game reminds me very much of the game Crashlands.  This RPG is well polished, looks very pretty, and the mechanics of it work nicely enough, but its just short of that special thing that makes the best of the best RPGs rise above the rest.  Its an adequate game that probably will not make you sorry that you spent money on it, but at the same time the way it presents its story isn't the most compelling so I doubt this will turn out to be anyone's favorite RPG unless they just adore cats and don't play many other RPGs.  Like Crashlands you'll find yourself doing a lot of fetch quests and running back and forth across the map to turn them in to advance the story, but this game is shorter than Crashlands and the world is smaller so its more likely you'll finish the game before you get tired of doing them.  If you can manage that in Crashlands then you deserve a medal. I'm fairly close to the end of the game with a little under 8 hours spent on it.  According to the achievements I have 2 more storyline quests and 2 more side quests to do.  The game does have a new game plus feature to replay it after you the first time so if you are a completionist you probably will get more hours out of it replaying it to get those achievements, but this is a fairly short game as RPGs go unless you count RPGmaker games.  There's also some optional dungeons I haven't done.  I think I still have around 25 dungeons I have not cleared, but understand that it only takes about 5 minutes to clear a dungeon.  In my book that makes this a little overpriced at $12.99, but I bought it on sale for $5 or $6 and I think it was worth the price I paid so I will recommend it if you can get it on sale.\n",

      "X[ 192 ]:  You get to talk to people around the world and its so fun. I didnt think that It was going to be one of those games that I could play for hours and lose track of time in, but with all of the custom avatars, Talented musicians,  and all of friendly people, its a blast. I havent had a bad experience so far in all of my time in the game so far and I dont think that Ill run into any in the future. If I do, I will edit this review but for now, I will enjoy my Time in this game. I do use the HTC Vive when I play this game so I cant really say what it is like in Mouse and Keyboard mode but if you have any VR headset, this game is a must have. Even if you dont have a VR headset, you should still give this game a try. Ive met so many people in the game that only use mouse and keyboard and they have hundreds of hours in the game so there is content for everyone and this content is endless. I should add that this game helps with your social skills a lot. Ive noticed that Im able to keep longer conversations now in the real world after talking for so long in VR chat. So for any people who struggle to talk to people, VRchat can really help. Ive heard about a lot of stories online (YouTube mostly) about how people come into this game to get over their fears of public interaction which I thought is kind of cool. To end this Review (Ive been rambling on long enough), I just want to say that I think that everyone who happens to come across this game needs to try it at least once and My guess is that they will be hooked. The great thing about VRchat is that its one of those games where anybody can play whether you are Female, Male, Old, young, it doesnt matter. Ive met some guys that are up to 50 years old and then Ive also met people who were like 5 years old so it is literally for anyone. Also, For the females out there, No its not one of those games where you get harassed. Im sure that it has happened but in my experience, all of the girls that ive met said that it really isnt that bad and seeing a girl in this game is actually pretty common. In fact I think that Every world that I go into, I think there is at least one girl. Like most games though, there are more guys on this game but for the most part, they are friendly people. This isnt CSGO or Rainbow six siege where people are just toxic and harass you. If you decide to download the game, Have Fun!\n",

      "X[ 194 ]:  Nice Short Review.  The game itself is fun and has a very strange learning curve. You gotta learn about sound cues when you're swinging your weapons around to confuse the enemy. There are a ton of customizations with armor and accessories, faces, voices and weapons in all shapes and sizes.  Community can be a bit toxic, but that's pretty much everywhere these days, still a ton of fun and awesome people in this game.  It's very active, plenty of people willing to help you learn and get better at the game as well.   I highly recommend this to people who want a First Person Melee game that has serious moments and silly moments. :)   TL;DR  Game Good, Big Cronch, Don't talk to strangers.\n",

Sure, it's dated. You need to look for some fixes on the minor tech problems to run it properly. And it's not that easy today to find all those modes that were so cool back in the days. Lightsaber Max. Blade Running Max. Max 10K guns... And the very best of all those additions, Kung Fu Mod. This \"review\" is quite biased, of course, since it's one of those games that I know from A to Z. It's the masterpiece that I was playing for months, even before I had it there on Steam account. I was able to finish it without crosshairs on the screen! 100/100 mark. A brilliant of the game industry.\n",

      "X[ 199 ]:  â€˜Payday 2â€™ is a fast-paced, slick, Co-operative First-Person Shooter (FPS) and a strong sequel to 2011â€™s cult-classic â€˜Payday: The Heistâ€™. While the first entry in the series was an un-polished gem, â€˜Payday 2â€™ is bigger, badder and flashier in nearly every regard - a taut, adrenaline-shot affair with explosive running gun-battles around every corner.   Gamers once again assume the role of one of four main protagonists â€“ Dallas, Chains, Hoxton or Wolf â€“ who after a few years in hiding, have descended upon Washington D.C in search of new scores. Originally developed by Overkill Software (a small Swedish Dev.), the franchise has since been acquired by Starbreeze | 505 Games and the larger budget for this late-2013 release is clearly evident in its improved production values - adding all the bells and whistles one would expect from a modern shooter.   â€“ Check â€“ The game consists of 17 unique heists (compared to 7 in the original) adding some great variety that can be played in Single-player (with AI bots) or Online Co-op, with an additional 3 Heists available as DLC.   â€“ Check â€“ The single biggest improvement from the original game is the inclusion of a deep and well fleshed-out â€˜Reward | Customization Systemâ€™ which allows gamers to use cash earned from heists to acquire and modify a large selection of new weapons and armor, customize masks for more personalized characters, unlock class-specific skills and perks, and customize load-outs for individual missions.   â€“ Check - With the introduction of  , the game also improves the ability to setup and find online heists across a variety of difficulty levels (from Normal to Overkill) through a well designed User Interface.    In considering its shortcomings, many gripes from the original â€˜Paydayâ€™ unfortunately remain â€“ A continued lack of a single player campaign, and rather simplistic AI, make for a somewhat one-dimensional experience over time. Additionally, graphics and gameplay are basically unchanged â€“ and average graphics (considered below-par for the first game in 2011) seem increasingly out of date in 2014. The randomized â€˜Reward-Drop Systemâ€™ for weapon upgrades | new masks is another area which needs re-work as evidenced by some pro gamers (400+ hours in-game) still unable to get that one mask or weapon upgrade they so crave. Team-balancing issues with online match-making, the seemingly interminable grind to unlock better toys, and a trend toward expensive DLC-only content, mar an otherwise strong offering.  In the final analysis, â€˜Payday 2â€™ is a great sequel and a phenomenal heist game, improving upon the original in key areas. A fantastic premise supported by a pulsating background score, frenetic action, a good selection of heists and a deep customization system add to the thrill of taking down scores with your crew. Familiar gripes, and some new ones to boot however give this entry a feeling of â€˜2 steps forward â€“ 1 step backâ€™, so while an overall improvement, its one achieved in steps not leaps and bounds.

      "X[ 209 ]:  Headlander is a retro style sci-fi metroidvania, with a very interesting concept, game play mechanics and atmosphere. I would like to firstly point out again, that this is a metroidvania and as such, it might not be a good choice for pure platformer fans. Why is that? - At some point you might find it repetitive, as you would have to go back to some areas and if you did not pay attention to the area objects and surroundings previously, you might find yourself a little bored or disappointed, having to have to go back to old areas or trying to overcome some obstacles (such as finding the correct body), as this is not a straightforward, as if it would be with pure platformers. So.... In Headlander you wake up in the ''near'' future in a retro-sci-fi environment, having no idea who you are or what had happened. Also you have only your head and no body. Upon ''waking'' up you are briefly instructed by your artificial companion's voice, informing you that everything went to sh*t and now you are the last hope for humanity (or at least the body part of humanity, that is intact).  Your core ability is to switch bodies with other robots, by removing their heads.  The story is not the strong part of the game and you may even miss out on it, if you don't pay attention to the monologue of your artificial companion's voice.  Overall, I had real fun (for the most part - metroidvanias/platformers are not my main genre, but I really appreciaed everything the game had to offer) - game mechanic and concept hooked me up for the game and I wasn't disappointed. Clever and interesting puzzles, hidden areas and easter eggs kept me going.   My journey so far - I decapitated a robotic snowman and violated its body's rights, became a robotic puppy and jumped around, used a giant smartphone's body to update my map area, became a duster from time to time and I danced a lot in different type of bodies - you can't do that in real life. My conclusion: Headlander is a great (but not a typical) metroidvania, so  give the game a chance and don't come to it with certain expectations, because of its genre.  For metroidvania fans, who like sci-fi retro themed games with good and interesting puzzles and concept - this game might be a great choice to put on your wishlist for the next Steam sale.\n",

      "X[ 230 ]:  At last; we finally have a new Terminator game - and it's an FPS! Sounds great, but how good is it? The game starts off fairly slow, but picks up at around an 1 1/2 to 2 hours in. This is the most boring part of the game: you'll mostly be walking around a barren map, looting crafting material, picking locks, and killing the same boring terminators over and over again, of which there aren't many. I think they wanted to slowly introduce the player to new mechanics, enemies, etc - but failed miserably at it. I feel that because of this, a lot of players will quit within 2 hours. With all that out of the way, let's get to the good part. The rest of the game after those first 1-2 hours are an absolute joy. You'll be introduced to a bunch of new fun weapons, enemies, and missions. The T-800s are absolutely amazing: their look, their behavior, their death animations, all very well done. These are easily the the funnest enemies to kill in the game, apart from one other terminator which I will not mention here because of spoilers.    The story is incredible as well. I really didn't expect there to be much of a story to this game, but damn did they put a lot of thought into this, and it fits in with the first 2 terminators so well. Yeah, I don't want to spoil much about it, but believe me when i say that if you're a fan of the terminator movies, you will get a kick out of this story. I didn't care much for the characters, but they do make the player feel like he has more purpose, and the dialogue can be interesting at times. What you say to them can affect your relationship with them, as well as affect the outcome of the game, which is really cool, The weapons are great. You'll start off with normal weapons, and will be introduced to plasma weapons later in the game. Every weapon in the game is fun to use, but damn do they give you too much ammo. Another thing that kind of annoyed me is that some weapons become completely obsolete very quickly. A good example is the UZI and Pistol. You'll pretty much never use these weapons once you acquire the M-16, which is like 10 minutes after you acquire the UZI. I did have some issues with the shotgun, but at least it's a viable weapon, even in later parts of the game for weaker terminators. The issue with this gun is the range; you literally can't hit anything beyond 10 feet, which is just dumb. The biggest issue I had in terms of weapons is the fact that a good chunk of them you won't acquire until the last few missions of the game - and some you won't even acquire until the very last mission of the game. These are also most fun weapons, hands down.    Easily the worst thing about this game is the endless amount of crafting material and trading tokens strewn about the entire map. You use the tokens to trade for more crafting materials, weapons, and ammo at the home base, and the crafting material is, well, obviously for crafting. Now, you definitely don't need to pick any of this stuff up, especially not all of it, but it's still annoying, The crafting is also bad, and that's mostly because you don't even need to do it, but also because there's nothing interesting about it. You can craft lock picks, ammo and some equipment, all of which you can find throughout the game, and is plentiful.  + Story + Characters + Weapons + Enemies + Graphics + Sound effects + Music   - Voice acting - Looting - Crafting - First 2 hours can be boring at times    Terminator: Resistance is easily the best Terminator game, even with its faults. I would absolutely recommend this game, and it's definitely worth playing, whether you're a Terminator fan or not.\n",

      "X[ 268 ]:  Wonderful game! The game takes place in 1930, when Nancy Drew visits her friend Emily, at the Lilac Inn...there Nancy encounters her first mystery, and becomes the detective we know and love. :)  I enjoyed this game enormously. The dialogue is solid and the voice acting is less wonky than in other games. The characters have fluid movement, and the game featured more cut-scenes than in other titles. There's history woven into the story too, and the setting is immersive - you'll believe you're actually with Nancy in the 30's!  The puzzles were on the easier side as well, esp. if you're playing on Junior Detective mode. One of the harder puzzles, at least for me, was the logic test, and the answers were sprinkled throughout the game. You can call Bess and George for hints too, or refer to your notebook (this title doesn't have the answers listed like the newer games, but it does provide helpful hints, and clues).  This does make the game feel shorter - for most Nancy Drew games, I finish them in 8-9 hours. I finished this in just under 6. (I still feel like it's worth the price, with how entertaining the story itself was.)  This is one of the older titles in the Nancy Drew series (released in 2005) and it does require a bit of patience to play. Some of the screens load slowly, and the dialogue sometimes carried through to the next scene. Nor does the game always react when you click on something; making you click on it more than once.  The graphics are rough at times, especially with certain characters like Uri, the cat (Dobby, is that you?). However, this game was so much fun to play, especially if you've played older Nancy Drew games, like Blackmoor Manor or the Haunted Carousel. This game is best for people who love Nancy Drew already, though it's worth a go either way. :)\n",

      "X[ 270 ]:  I can see the logic behind the negative reviews. This game is not for everyone. It requires patience, reflexes and somewhat grinding for achievements - therefore the items.  Now if you are not a fan of rogue-like, action genre, this game wouldn't be the best match for you. If you are, however and want to have some fun, this game suits your needs perfectly. I will start with saying that the game is really hard. This doesn't make the game frustrating though. After you get the grasp of the mechanics and familiar with the items, it will be only a matter of time to finish the game.  David Bowie (RIP) is a playable character in this game (Though I don't think he would appreciate the choice of soundtrack.).  Gameplay is fast-paced. That means there will be times you won't even understand how you died or took massive amount of damage. So never rely on your health being full. You always need to be alert and keep your reflexes up because the ways to die in this game are just too many. Like most of the rogue-like dungeon crawlers, RNG factor is significant. Game has six different characters with a huge item pool. There are many things that could make reaching the end a piece of cake. You can get the most OP items on the first floors, you can pray to RNG gods and get some ridiculous stats with the passive items,  you can find the boss room without too much wandering around the rooms and these thing also could make the runs really hard vica-versa.   Simple, pixelated, yet colorful graphics makes the game charming and kind of fits the style of the game itself, in my opinion.  Music is... well, it is dubstep. Depends on your approach to electro music. Although I don't like dubstep myself, it fits the fast-paced theme and makes you randomly jump and shoot to everyone and everywhere, because the groove is real.  Gameplay: 8/10 Graphics 7/10 Music: 7/10 Replay value: 9/10 Overall: 7.5/10, a good game for dungeon crawler or dubstep fans.\n",

Whats New in Counter Strike : Global Offensive is the New Server System, when joining a Server you can either use the old fashioned Server Browser or the New System, that automatically searches A random game for you in a game Mode you want to Play. You can choose between \"Deatchmatch Mode, Arms Race Mode, Demolition Mode in the Classic Menu you can Choose between \"Defuse Mission and Hostage Mission (when you have bought the Operation Payback Pass you can choose these maps aswell).  Whats new too is, that you can create a Lobby out of Friends where you can set the gamemmode and some advanced settings. Then the game searches for a Server and you can play with your friends without owning a own Server. â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… 5/5 Stars + New Features inside of the game. + Arms-Race Mode + Deathmatch Mode + Demolition Mode.\n",

      "X[ 323 ]:  Well, now that I've achieved all achievements I feel that I should contribute and review this game! This is the first time I've played a game like this and it was actually a pretty good experience overall, especially since this game was Free-to-Play!  The first thing I noticed and liked about this game was how it has full voice acting! The voices seemed to portray the characters in the game pretty well and provided the player with an immersive experience. But even though overall the voices were a pro for me, there were times when I felt the voices got excessive and annoying but I learned that it can be countered by just disabling the feature or just clicking through the dialogue. Another thing I loved about the game was how each \"romance target\" had a different story to tell. There were some overlays in history between the Demon Brothers but overall they each had different reasons for doing the things they did. Also great background music! I found the music pretty catchy in this game (especially the ringtone). Some things I did not like as much was some of the art, how some parts of the story didn't go into enough detail, and the repetitiveness. Well the characters seemed slightly disproportionate and there were some people in the game that I thought looked like a mutant (the teacher) but I didn't expect too much out of a Free-to-Play game. The creator of the game provided a lot of cut scene art though so even though it wasn't amazing, it still provided players with a source of visual aid for the verbal descriptions and dialogue. So even though not great, still better than nothing at all. Also I felt like the story had the potential to become something better but because of the objective of the game (seduce everybody), everything was just glossed over and never really dug into. I mean at times I just felt information was shot at me and that I never really had the chance to digest it. If the creators went more in depth and explained some of the story, I felt the game would have been even better (I learned there was a sequel so its possible that they'll go more indepth on the story then). Last thing I thought was a con was the repetitiveness of the game. It is kind of to be expected since most of the individual characters' plots touch upon others but I still can't help but find it tedious to read the same thing over and over and over (I'm talking about the parts that aren't skippable but are still the same for almost all the characters (like the pre-ending dialogue.) Overall Pros: FREE! Voice acting included Background music Interesting story Cons: Some of the art Not going indepth on story Repetitiveness Yup~ I would definitely recommend this game to people who are fans of female dating sims, especially since its free. Though there were cons, I felt that they weren't major enough to detract from the game. I was still able to enjoy it when I played through all the routes. Oh yeah! This game has male and female romance targets and not just all-male or all-female so people with different preferences can still enjoy the game.\n",
